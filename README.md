# üåç World Life Expectancy Project (SQL)

üìä **Project Overview**  
This project explores **world life expectancy data** using **MySQL**.  
It includes **data cleaning** steps to prepare the dataset and  
**exploratory analysis** to answer key questions about life expectancy trends, GDP, country status (Developed vs Developing), BMI, and adult mortality.  

The project demonstrates SQL skills in:  
- Cleaning and standardising raw data  
- Query design for descriptive and comparative analysis  
- Using window functions for cumulative metrics  
- Exporting results for interpretation  
- Linking insights to global health and development context

## ‚ùì Key Questions & Findings

### 1. How much has life expectancy improved by country over time?
- **Finding:** By calculating the minimum and maximum life expectancy for each country, we can see which countries achieved the largest gains over the dataset period. Many nations show **double-digit improvements** over the span of roughly 15 years, reflecting advances in healthcare, economic growth, and social development.  
  - Example: Emerging economies in Asia and Africa saw improvements of **10+ years**, while more developed nations improved at a slower rate (already near the global maximum).  
  - At the other end, a handful of countries show **minimal progress** due to persistent conflict, poor healthcare infrastructure, or disease burden.

### 2. What is the global life expectancy trend year by year?
- **Finding:** Global average life expectancy increases steadily across the years captured in this dataset. The trend reflects **consistent global progress** in healthcare access, vaccines, sanitation, and poverty reduction.  
  - The world average rises by several years over the dataset window, showing that even incremental improvements compound into substantial gains at the global level.  
  - Smaller dips or plateaus can signal the impact of **localised crises** (wars, epidemics, or economic downturns).

### 3. How does GDP relate to life expectancy?
- **Finding:**  
  - **By country averages:** There is a strong positive relationship between a country‚Äôs wealth (GDP) and its life expectancy. Nations with higher average GDP ‚Äî such as those in Western Europe and parts of East Asia ‚Äî also tend to have higher average life expectancy.  
  - **By GDP buckets (‚â•1500 vs <1500):** Splitting the dataset into high- vs low-GDP groups confirms the pattern. The **High-GDP group** shows average life expectancy several years higher than the **Low-GDP group**, emphasising the role of economic resources in extending life.  
  - **Outliers:** Some resource-rich countries with relatively high GDP per capita do not achieve the life expectancy levels of peers due to inequality, governance challenges, or public health issues.

### 4. Do ‚ÄúDeveloped‚Äù vs ‚ÄúDeveloping‚Äù countries differ in life expectancy?
- **Finding:** A clear gap exists between **Developed** and **Developing** countries.  
  - Developed countries consistently report **average life expectancies in the high 70s or 80s**, reflecting strong healthcare systems, better nutrition, and lower infant mortality.  
  - Developing countries average significantly lower, sometimes in the **50s or 60s**, due to systemic challenges.  
  - Counting countries by status also shows the dataset skews towards more Developing entries, meaning much of the world still faces barriers to catching up.  
  - This highlights not just the gap, but also the **scale of inequality** in global health.

### 5. Is there a relationship between BMI and life expectancy?
- **Finding:** The analysis suggests a **positive association** between BMI and life expectancy at the country level.  
  - Nations with higher average BMI often report higher life expectancy.  
  - In developed economies, higher BMI reflects **calorie availability and food security** ‚Äî correlating with improved survival rates.  
  - Conversely, lower-BMI countries often overlap with lower-income nations, where **malnutrition contributes to shorter lifespans**.  
  - It is descriptive, not causal ‚Äî beyond a certain point, very high BMI is associated with health risks.

### 6. How has adult mortality accumulated across countries over time?
- **Finding:** The rolling (cumulative) totals of adult mortality provide a **long-term picture of health challenges**.  
  - Countries with **persistent health crises, high disease burdens, or weaker healthcare systems** accumulate much higher mortality totals across the observed years.  
  - **Sub-Saharan African nations** tend to appear with higher cumulative totals, reflecting the combined impact of infectious diseases and limited healthcare resources.  
  - Many developed countries show slower accumulation due to stronger preventive and curative care systems.

## üöÄ Key Insights
- **Life expectancy is rising globally**, but improvements are uneven, with some countries gaining over 10 years in a short period while others stagnate.  
- **Economic prosperity (GDP)** strongly correlates with longevity, though exceptions reveal the importance of governance, equity, and healthcare access.  
- **Developed vs Developing gap** persists: richer countries live longer, but gradual convergence is visible in some regions.  
- **BMI correlation** reflects food security and living standards, but is not causal ‚Äî beyond a threshold, high BMI can be a health risk.  
- **Adult mortality analysis** highlights regions facing chronic health crises, showing how inequality compounds over time.
